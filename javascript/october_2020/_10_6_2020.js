/*
Given two array of integers(arr1,arr2). Your task is going to find a 
pair of numbers(an element in arr1, and another element in arr2), their difference is as big as 
possible(absolute value); Again, you should to find a pair of numbers, their difference is as small as 
possible. Return the maximum and minimum difference values by an array: [ max difference, min difference ]

For example:

 Given arr1 = [3,10,5], arr2 = [20,7,15,8]
 should return [17,2] because 20 - 3 = 17, 10 - 8 = 2
